  "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the given JSON data. Let me start by understanding the user's profile.\n\nThe user is a 50-year-old male, weighing 85 kg and 180 cm tall. His main goal is to gain muscle, which is \"gain_muscle\". He's classified as advanced in experience, so the workout should be challenging but safe. He works out three times a week and has access to a gym, which is great because we can include a variety of equipment.\n\nSince his goal is muscle gain, the focus should be on resistance training with compound movements. As an advanced lifter, he can handle higher weights and more complex exercises. But I should ensure the plan is balanced to avoid overtraining.\n\nI need to choose up to 7 exercises. Let me think about covering all major muscle groups: chest, back, shoulders, legs, and maybe some core. For each exercise, I should include instructions that are clear, considering his advanced level but also ensuring proper form to prevent injury.\n\nGiven he has no physical restrictions, I can include exercises that require full mobility. Since he's at an advanced level, I can suggest higher weights and lower reps for strength, but since the goal is muscle gain, maybe a mix of hypertrophy reps (8-12) and some heavier sets could be beneficial.\n\nI should also vary the exercises to keep the workout engaging. Maybe include some variations like incline bench press for the upper chest, pull-ups for the back, shoulder presses, and squats or deadlifts for legs. For core, maybe some hanging leg raises or planks.\n\nThe workout name should be catchy and modern, avoiding the word \"Treino\". Something like \"Força Máxima\" or \"Musculação Avançada\". The observations should be a brief, motivating note about the workout focusing on muscle gain.\n\nI need to structure each exercise with specific sets, reps, weights, and rest times. Since he's advanced, rest periods can be a bit shorter to keep the intensity up, but not too short to compromise recovery.\n\nLet me outline the exercises:\n\n1. Bench Press for chest.\n2. Incline Bench Press for upper chest.\n3. Pull-ups for back.\n4. Barbell Rows for back thickness.\n5. Overhead Shoulder Press for shoulders.\n6. Deadlifts for overall strength and legs.\n7. Hanging Leg Raises for core.\n\nEach exercise should have 4 sets, with reps around 8-12 for hypertrophy, except maybe deadlifts which can be lower reps with higher weight. Rest periods between sets around 60-90 seconds, and a bit more between exercises.\n\nI should calculate the calories burned for each exercise, but that might be approximate. The weight used should be challenging but manageable for his advanced level.\n\nFinally, I'll compile all this into a JSON structure, ensuring all fields are correctly filled and the instructions are detailed enough for him to follow without confusion.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Musculação Avançada\",\n  \"workoutObs\": \"Treino intenso para ganho de massa muscular, explorando exercícios compostos e isolados.\",\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Supino reto com barra\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Peitoral\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se no banco reto, empurre a barra para cima, estendendo os braços totalmente e expire na fase de força.
