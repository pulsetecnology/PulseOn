  "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the user's JSON data. Let me start by understanding the user's profile.\n\nThe user is 50 years old, weighs 85kg, and is 180cm tall. His main goal is to gain muscle, which is \"gain_muscle\". He's a beginner, so the exercises should be suitable for someone just starting out. He can work out three times a week, which is good for consistency without overtraining.\n\nLooking at his equipment, he has access to a gym, which is great because that offers a variety of machines and weights. However, he has a physical restriction: he fractured his forearm and has a plate with eight screws. That means any exercise that puts strain on his forearms or wrists needs to be avoided or modified. So, I should focus on exercises that don't require heavy gripping or putting pressure on the forearm.\n\nHis main goal is muscle gain, so the workout should focus on hypertrophy. As a beginner, I should choose compound movements that work multiple muscle groups but are also low-risk given his injury. Since he can't do heavy gripping, I'll avoid exercises like pull-ups, rows with bars, or anything that requires holding heavy weights with his forearms.\n\nLet me think about each muscle group:\n\n1. Chest: Push-ups are a good option since they don't require gripping. Alternatively, using a chest press machine at the gym would be better because it doesn't strain the forearms as much as using free weights.\n\n2. Shoulders: Shoulder presses with a machine or light dumbbells could work. Lateral raises might be okay if done with light weights and proper form to avoid wrist strain.\n\n3. Back: Lat pulldown machines are good because they use a wider grip, but I need to ensure he doesn't strain his forearms. Alternatively, seated rows with a rope or strap that doesn't require gripping a bar.\n\n4. Legs: Leg press machines are perfect because they work the legs without needing to hold weights. Lunges could be tricky if he needs to hold dumbbells, so maybe bodyweight lunges or using a leg press.\n\n5. Core: Planks are great because they don't require any equipment and are easy on the forearms. Russian twists with a light weight or even without could be an option.\n\nNow, considering the workout structure, since he's a beginner and has limited time (45 minutes per session, 3 times a week), I should create a full-body workout each time to maximize efficiency. Each session should target all major muscle groups with 3-4 exercises, each with 3 sets of moderate repetitions (around 10-15 reps) to focus on hypertrophy.\n\nI also need to ensure that the exercises don't put excessive strain on his forearms. So, avoiding any exercises that require gripping with the forearm, like deadlifts, rows with a barbell, or pull-ups. Instead, using machines where possible or modifying exercises to reduce forearm involvement.\n\nLet me outline the workout plan:\n\n1. Chest Press Machine: This works the chest without forearm strain. He can do 3 sets of 10-12 reps.\n\n2. Seated Row Machine: Using a strap or rope handle to minimize forearm grip. 3 sets of 10-12 reps.\n\n3. Shoulder Press Machine: Again, using a machine to avoid heavy gripping. 3 sets of 10-12 reps.\n\n4. Leg Press Machine: Targets legs effectively without forearm strain. 3 sets of 10-12 reps.\n\n5. Plank: For core, which doesn't affect the forearms. Hold for 30-60 seconds, 3 sets.\n\n6. Russian Twists: Using a light weight or bodyweight, 3 sets of 15-20 reps.\n\n7. Bicycle Crunches: Another core exercise that's easy on the forearms, 3 sets of 15-20 reps.\n\nFor each exercise, the instructions should be clear to ensure proper form and avoid injury. Rest times between sets and exercises should be adequate to allow recovery but keep the workout moving within the 45-minute window.\n\nI need to make sure the workout name is catchy and the observations are encouraging and informative, explaining that the workout avoids forearm strain while building muscle.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Força Total sem Sobrecarga\",\n  \"workoutObs\": \"Treino equilibrado focado no ganho de força e massa muscular, evitando movimentos que possam sobrecarregar o antebraço.
