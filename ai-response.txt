  "output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the user's JSON data. Let me start by understanding the user's profile.\n\nThe user is 50 years old, weighs 85kg, and is 180cm tall. His goal is to gain muscle, which means focusing on strength training. He's a beginner, so the exercises should be manageable but effective. He has access to a gym, which is great because it offers more equipment options.\n\nOne major consideration is his physical restriction: he fractured his forearm and has a plate with 8 screws. This means any exercise that puts strain on the wrists or forearms should be avoided or modified. So, I need to choose exercises that don't require heavy gripping or twisting with the wrists.\n\nLooking at the weekly frequency, he works out 3 times a week. Each session should be around 60 minutes. I should balance the workouts to target different muscle groups each day to allow recovery.\n\nFor the first workout, I'll focus on the chest and triceps since these are larger muscle groups and can handle heavier weights without straining the forearm. However, I'll avoid using a barbell for bench press because it might put too much pressure on his wrists. Instead, dumbbell bench press is a safer option because it allows for a neutral grip, reducing wrist strain.\n\nNext, incline dumbbell presses will target the upper chest without needing a barbell. For triceps, skull crushers with a rope or straight bar are good, but I should advise using a bar that doesn't require a tight grip. Tricep dips can be done on a machine to minimize wrist involvement.\n\nThe second workout should target the back and biceps. Pull-ups are great, but I should suggest using a neutral grip to ease wrist stress. Lat pulldowns with a rope allow for a wider grip, which is easier on the wrists. Seated rows can be done with a chest-supported bench to keep the back straight and reduce forearm strain. Bicep curls should use dumbbells with a neutral grip or an EZ bar for comfort.\n\nThe third workout will focus on legs and shoulders. Leg press is a good compound exercise that doesn't strain the wrists. Lunges can be done without weights or with dumbbells held carefully. For shoulders, a seated dumbbell press with a neutral grip is better. Lateral raises and reverse pec deck target the shoulders without heavy gripping.\n\nI need to ensure each exercise has clear instructions to avoid aggravating his forearm injury. Rest periods should be adequate to prevent overexertion. The workout name should be motivating, and the observations should explain the focus and modifications clearly.\n\nLet me structure each workout with 3-4 exercises, ensuring no overlap in muscle groups to allow proper recovery. Each exercise should have 4 sets with 8-12 reps to focus on hypertrophy. Weights should start moderate but allow for progression as he gains strength.\n\nI'll make sure the JSON output follows the required structure, including exercise details, instructions, sets, reps, and rest times. The names should be catchy and the observations should be encouraging and informative.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Força Total com Cuidado\",\n  \"workoutObs\": \"Treino focado no ganho de massa muscular, respeitando as restrições no antebraço.
