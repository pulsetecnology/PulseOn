  "output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the user's JSON data. Let's start by analyzing the input.\n\nThe user is a 50-year-old male, weighing 85kg and 180cm tall. His goal is to gain muscle, which means the focus should be on strength training and hypertrophy. He's classified as advanced, so the exercises should be challenging and varied to avoid plateaus.\n\nHe has access to a gym, which means I can include a wide range of equipment like barbells, dumbbells, and machines. Since there are no physical restrictions, I can push him with compound movements and some heavy lifting.\n\nThe weekly frequency is 3 times, so the workout plan should be efficient. Each session should target different muscle groups to allow recovery. Given his advanced level, I'll aim for 4 sets per exercise with higher weights and lower reps to focus on strength and muscle building.\n\nLooking at the example JSON, the structure includes exercise name, muscle group, type, instructions, time, series, reps, rest periods, weight, and calories. I need to ensure each exercise fits into this structure.\n\nI'll choose exercises that work multiple muscle groups to maximize efficiency. For example, the barbell bench press for the chest, pull-ups for the back, barbell rows for back and arms, dumbbell shoulder press for shoulders, bench dips for triceps, bicep curls with dumbbells, and cable crunches for abs.\n\nEach exercise should have 4 sets with 8-10 reps, using weights that challenge him. Rest periods between sets should be 60 seconds, and 90 seconds between exercises to allow recovery without wasting time.\n\nThe workout name should be catchy and reflect the goal, something like \"Musculação Avançada.\" The observation should explain the focus on muscle gain and strength.\n\nNow, I'll structure each exercise with the required details, ensuring the weights and times align with his advanced level and the equipment available. I'll make sure the instructions are clear and concise for each movement.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Musculação Avançada\",\n  \"workoutObs\": \"Treino intenso para ganho de massa muscular, utilizando exercícios compostos e isolados em série.\",\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Supino reto com barra\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Peitoral\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se no banco e empurre a barra para cima, estendendo os braços totalmente.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 8,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 40,\n      \"calories\": 80\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Puxada alta na barra\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Costas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Agarre a barra com as mãos ligeiramente além da largura dos ombros e puxe até a barra tocar o peito.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 8,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 30,\n      \"calories\": 70\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Remada curvada com barra\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Costas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Abaixe-se levemente, segure a barra com as mãos na largura dos ombros e puxe a barra até os joelhos.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 8,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 35,\n      \"calories\": 75\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Elevação militar com halteres\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Ombros\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, segure os halteres nos ombros e empurre para cima até braços estendidos.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 8,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 20,\n      \"calories\": 60\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Dips no banco\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Tríceps\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Coloque as mãos no banco, incline o corpo para frente e faça movimento de flexão.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 50\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Rosca direta com halteres\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Bíceps\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, segure os halteres com as mãos viradas para frente e levante os halteres até os ombros.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 15,\n      \"calories\": 55\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Crunch torcendo no banco inclinado\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Abdomen\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se no banco inclinado, levante o tronco e toque os joelhos com os cotovelos alternadamente.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 45\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
