  "output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the user's JSON data. Let me start by analyzing the input carefully.\n\nThe user is a 50-year-old male, weighing 85 kg and 180 cm tall. His main goal is to lose weight. He has an intermediate experience level, which means the exercises shouldn't be too basic but also not overly complicated. He can work out three times a week, so I need to make sure the plan is manageable within that frequency.\n\nLooking at his available equipment, he only has bodyweight and others. Since he has tendinitis in his right shoulder and is experiencing pain, I must avoid any exercises that could strain his shoulder. That means no overhead presses, heavy lifting, or movements that involve putting pressure on the shoulders.\n\nHis goal is weight loss, so the plan should focus on burning calories. I'll include a mix of cardio and strength training. Since he can't use heavy equipment, bodyweight exercises are the way to go, but I need to choose ones that don't hurt his shoulder.\n\nI should consider low-impact cardio to minimize strain. Mountain climbers are a good option because they get the heart rate up without using the shoulders much. Plank jacks are also effective for the core and legs without involving the shoulders.\n\nFor strength, I need to target major muscle groups without involving the shoulders. Squats and lunges are perfect for the legs. I can modify them if needed, like bodyweight squats or using a chair for support. Glute bridges will target the glutes without shoulder strain.\n\nCore exercises are important for overall stability. A modified plank on the knees can be easier on the shoulders. Russian twists can be done with a light weight or even without any to avoid shoulder pain.\n\nIncluding a full-body movement like burpees (modified to avoid jumping) can help with weight loss, but I need to make sure it's shoulder-friendly. Maybe a step-back lunge with a push-up, avoiding the jump up.\n\nI should structure each exercise with clear instructions, considering his physical restrictions. Repetitions and series should be manageable for an intermediate level but still challenging enough to promote weight loss. Rest periods between exercises and series should be adequate to prevent overexertion.\n\nI'll make sure each workout is balanced, hitting different muscle groups each day to allow recovery. Since he works out three times a week, each session can focus on different areas but still contribute to overall calorie burn.\n\nLastly, I'll ensure the plan is varied and motivating, including a warm-up and cool-down to prevent injury and promote flexibility. The exercises should be creative within the constraints to keep the workouts engaging and effective.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Treino Funcional para Emagrecimento com Cuidado ao Ombro\",\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Mountain Climbers\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Core\",\n      \"type\": \"Aeróbico\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique em posição de prancha alta, alternando joelhos em direção ao peito o mais rápido possível.\",\n      \"time\": 30,\n      \"timeExec\": 45,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 70\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Prancha com Elevação de Quadril\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Core\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique em posição de prancha baixa, eleve o quadril lentamente e mantenha por 2 segundos antes de descer.\",\n      \"time\": 30,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 30\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Agachamento com Suporte\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, agache-se até os joelhos estarem levemente dobrados, use uma cadeira para suporte se necessário.\",\n      \"time\": 30,\n      \"timeExec\": 25,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 40\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Ponte de Glúteos\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Glúteos\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se de costas com joelhos dobrados, levante os quadris até a linha dos ombros.\",\n      \"time\": 30,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 35\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Torção Russa\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Core\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Sentado no chão com joelhos levemente dobrados, gire o tronco de um lado para o outro.\",\n      \"time\": 30,\n      \"timeExec\": 25,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 20,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 30\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Plank com Abdução de Pernas\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Core\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique em posição de prancha alta, levante uma perna lateralmente e volte.\",\n      \"time\": 30,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 30\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Burpee Modificado\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Full Body\",\n      \"type\": \"Aeróbico\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, agache-se e faça uma prancha, retorne e dê um pulo suave sem envolver o ombro.\",\n      \"time\": 30,\n      \"timeExec\": 40,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 80\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
