  "output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a personalized workout plan for a user based on their JSON data. Let me start by analyzing the provided information.\n\nThe user is 50 years old, weighs 85kg, and is 180cm tall. Their fitness goal is to gain muscle, which means the focus should be on resistance training. They have a beginner experience level, so the exercises should be foundational and not too complex.\n\nLooking at their physical restrictions, they had a forearm fracture with a plate and screws five months ago. This means I need to avoid any exercises that put strain on the forearm or wrists, like heavy gripping or twists. So, I should focus on upper body exercises that don't require intense forearm use and include lower body and core exercises that are safe.\n\nThey have access to a gym, which is great because it offers a variety of equipment. I can include machines and some free weights, but I need to be cautious with their forearm. \n\nThe weekly frequency is three times, so the plan should be efficient within that. Each session should be about 60-90 minutes. \n\nStarting with the upper body, I should choose exercises that work major muscle groups without straining the forearm. Chest presses with machines are good because they don't require gripping. For shoulders, seated shoulder presses with dumbbells can be modified to avoid heavy loads. Lat pulldowns are excellent for the back without needing forearm strain.\n\nFor the lower body, leg presses are a solid choice since they don't involve the upper body much. Lunges can be done without weights or with bodyweight to be safe.\n\nCore exercises like seated crunches and planks are good for stability without putting pressure on the arms.\n\nI should structure each exercise with clear instructions, focusing on proper form to prevent injury. Repetitions and sets should be manageable for a beginner, with adequate rest periods.\n\nFinally, the workout name should be engaging and the observations should motivate the user, acknowledging their situation and the focus on muscle gain without overexertion.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Força Total com Cuidado\",\n  \"workoutObs\": \"Treino adaptado para ganho de massa muscular, evitando movimentos que possam afetar o antebraço.
