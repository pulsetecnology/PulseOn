  "output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the user's JSON data. Let me start by analyzing the provided information.\n\nThe user is 50 years old, weighs 85kg, and is 180cm tall. Their fitness goal is athletic performance, and they're a competitive athlete with access to a gym. They have no physical restrictions, which is great.\n\nSince their goal is athletic performance, the workout should focus on strength, power, and endurance. Considering they're a competitive athlete, the plan should be intense but safe. They can train three times a week, so I need to structure each session effectively.\n\nI'll include exercises that target major muscle groups and improve overall athleticism. I should vary the exercises to keep it engaging. Let's think about compound movements like deadlifts, bench presses, and pull-ups as they're effective for building strength.\n\nFor each exercise, I'll provide clear instructions, considering their experience level. They should know how to perform each move correctly to avoid injury and get the most out of the workout. Rest periods are important too, so I'll include adequate rest times between sets and exercises.\n\nI'll make sure the workout name is catchy and the observations are motivating. The plan should be balanced, hitting different muscle groups each day to allow for recovery. I'll ensure that the total number of exercises doesn't exceed seven as per the instructions.\n\nAlright, putting it all together, I'll structure each day to focus on different aspects of athletic performance, ensuring each session is comprehensive and challenging enough for a competitive athlete.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Desempenho Atlético Avançado\",\n  \"workoutObs\": \"Treino intensivo para melhorar a performance atlética, com foco em força, potência e resistência.
