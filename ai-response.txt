  "output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the user's JSON data. Let me start by analyzing the provided information.\n\nThe user is 50 years old, weighs 85kg, and is 180cm tall. Their fitness goal is to gain muscle, which means the focus should be on resistance training. They have a beginner experience level, so the exercises should be foundational and not too complex.\n\nLooking at their physical restrictions, they had a forearm fracture with a plate and 8 screws 5 months ago. This means I need to avoid any exercises that put strain on the forearm or wrist, especially those involving heavy gripping or twisting. So, exercises like deadlifts, barbell curls, or any that require gripping with the forearm are out.\n\nThey have access to a gym, which is great because it offers a variety of equipment. I should focus on machines that don't require heavy gripping but still target major muscle groups effectively.\n\nThe weekly frequency is 3 times, so the workout should be efficient but not overly demanding. Each session should be around 60-90 minutes, considering warm-up, workout, and cool-down.\n\nSince the user is a beginner, I'll choose compound movements that work multiple muscles at once but are safe for their condition. For example, leg press instead of squats to minimize forearm strain, chest press with a machine to avoid heavy barbells, shoulder press with lateral raises for shoulder development without heavy weights, and seated rows to target the back without gripping.\n\nI'll include core exercises like seated abdominal crunches, which are gentle on the arms. For the lower body, leg curls and extensions on machines will work the legs without needing heavy lifting.\n\nEach exercise should have clear instructions to ensure proper form, especially considering their forearm injury. Repetitions will be in the hypertrophy range (8-12 reps) with moderate weights to build muscle without excessive strain.\n\nRest periods between sets and exercises should be adequate to allow recovery but not too long to maintain efficiency. I'll also include a warm-up and cool-down to prevent injury and promote flexibility.\n\nThe workout name should be catchy and relevant, maybe something like \"Força e Volume\" to indicate strength and muscle building. The observations should motivate them and highlight the focus on major muscle groups without overloading the forearms.\n\nI need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, with each exercise having all the necessary properties. The total number of exercises should be around 7, as per the instructions.\n\nLet me put this all together into a JSON format, ensuring each exercise is suitable, the instructions are clear, and the plan aligns with the user's goals and restrictions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Força e Volume\",\n  \"workoutObs\": \"Treino focado no ganho de massa muscular, respeitando as restrições no antebraço.
