  "output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the user's JSON data. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is 50 years old, weighs 85kg, and is 180cm tall. His main goal is to gain muscle, which is important because it influences the type of exercises and the focus areas. He's a beginner, so the exercises should be manageable but effective.\n\nHe has a physical restriction: a forearm fracture with a plate and screws. That means I need to avoid any exercises that could strain his forearms or wrists. So, no heavy gripping or movements that could put pressure on that area.\n\nHe has access to a gym, which is great because it offers more equipment options. However, due to his injury, I should focus on machines that don't require heavy gripping or any stress on the forearms.\n\nLooking at his goal of gaining muscle, compound movements are key, but they need to be adapted to his situation. Maybe seated chest presses instead of bench presses to avoid heavy gripping. For legs, leg presses are good because they don't require holding weights.\n\nI should include core exercises that don't strain the arms, like seated abdominal crunches. For the back, maybe seated rows with a neutral grip or using a chest-supported row machine to minimize forearm stress.\n\nEach exercise should have clear instructions, avoiding any movements that could harm his forearm. Repetitions around 10-12 seem appropriate for muscle gain, with 4 sets each. Rest periods should be adequate to allow recovery but not too long to maintain intensity.\n\nI'll make sure each exercise targets a major muscle group without putting pressure on the injured area. The workout name should reflect the focus on muscle gain while being cautious of his injury. The observation should mention the adaptative approach due to his physical condition.\n\nI need to keep the plan varied but safe, ensuring he can progress without risking his forearm. Each exercise should be machine-based where possible to reduce strain on the forearms.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the workout with 7 exercises, each with specific instructions, sets, reps, and rest times, ensuring it's balanced and covers all major muscle groups safely.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Força Adaptada - Ganho de Massa\",\n  \"workoutObs\": \"Treino adaptado para ganho de massa muscular, respeitando a limitação no antebraço.
