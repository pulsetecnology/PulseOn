  "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the user's JSON data. Let's see, the user is 50 years old, weighs 85 kg, and is 180 cm tall. His main goal is to gain muscle, which is \"gain_muscle\". He's a beginner, so the exercises should be suitable for someone starting out. \n\nHe has a physical restriction: he fractured his forearm and had a plate with 8 screws put in 5 months ago. That means I need to avoid any exercises that could strain his forearm or wrists. So, no heavy gripping or bending, probably avoiding barbells or exercises that require a firm grip for now.\n\nHe has access to a gym, which is good because we can use machines and some equipment that doesn't require heavy gripping. His weekly frequency is 3 times, so the plan should be split into 3 days, maybe focusing on different muscle groups each day to allow recovery.\n\nSince he's a beginner, the exercises should be basic but effective. I should focus on compound movements but modify them to avoid stressing the forearm. For example, chest presses can be done with machines instead of free weights to minimize grip strain.\n\nLooking at the sample JSON, each exercise has specific details. I need to make sure each exercise is adapted to his condition. For example, using a chest press machine instead of bench press with a barbell. Similarly, for rows, using a seated row machine where he can push with his feet or legs instead of pulling with his arms.\n\nI should also include some core exercises that don't require heavy arm movements, like seated crunches or leg raises. Maybe some leg exercises that are low impact on the arms, like leg presses or seated leg curls and extensions.\n\nEach workout should have a warm-up, maybe some light cardio or dynamic stretching to prevent injury. The instructions for each exercise need to be clear, emphasizing proper form to avoid strain on the forearm.\n\nI should structure the workout into three days: maybe push day (chest, shoulders, triceps), pull day (back, biceps), and leg day (legs and core). But since he's a beginner, maybe a full-body approach each day with different focuses.\n\nWait, but the sample JSON had only one exercise. Since the user can do up to 7 exercises, I should include a variety, but no more than 7 in total across the three days. Maybe each day has 2-3 exercises.\n\nI need to make sure the weights are manageable. Starting with lower weights and focusing on form. The rest periods should be adequate to allow recovery between sets and exercises.\n\nAlso, the workout name should be catchy and relevant, avoiding the word \"Treino\". Maybe something like \"Força e Volume\" since his goal is muscle gain.\n\nIn the workout observations, I should mention that the exercises are adapted to his physical condition, avoiding strain on the forearm, and that the plan is designed to build muscle safely.\n\nEach exercise should have clear instructions, specifying the equipment to use and how to perform it without straining the forearm. For example, using a chest press machine with a neutral grip or pushing with the feet in seated rows.\n\nI should also calculate the calories burned, but since it's a muscle gain plan, the focus is more on resistance training rather than cardio.\n\nAlright, putting it all together, I'll structure the workout plan into three days, each targeting different muscle groups with exercises that don't strain the forearm. Each exercise will have detailed instructions, appropriate sets, reps, and rest times. The workout name will be something motivating, and the observations will explain the approach taken considering his physical condition.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Força e Volume\",\n  \"workoutObs\": \"Treino adaptado para ganho de massa muscular, respeitando as restrições físicas e utilizando equipamentos da academia de forma segura.\",\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Supino reto com halteres\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Peitoral\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se no banco reto, segure os halteres acima do peito com as palmas das mãos voltadas para frente.
