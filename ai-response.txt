  "output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the user's JSON data. Let's start by analyzing the provided information.\n\nThe user is 50 years old, weighs 85kg, and is 180cm tall. Their main goal is to lose weight, and they have an intermediate level of experience. They can work out three times a week, which is a good frequency for consistent progress.\n\nLooking at their physical restrictions, they have tendinite in the right shoulder, which causes pain. This is crucial because it means I need to avoid any exercises that might strain the shoulder, especially overhead movements or heavy lifting that could exacerbate the injury.\n\nThe available equipment includes bodyweight and others. Since they don't have access to specific gym equipment beyond that, I'll focus on bodyweight exercises and maybe some that can be done with minimal or alternative equipment to not aggravate the shoulder.\n\nThe main objective is weight loss, so the plan should include a mix of cardio and strength training to burn calories and build muscle, which helps in increasing metabolism. However, given the shoulder issue, I need to be careful with the selection of exercises to avoid any movements that might cause pain or further injury.\n\nLet me think about the exercises. For cardio, jumping jacks are a full-body movement that doesn't strain the shoulders much. Mountain climbers are another good option that can get the heart rate up without using the shoulders heavily. Plank to knee taps might be modified to be easier on the shoulders, but I need to ensure the user can perform it without pain.\n\nFor strength training, bodyweight squats are great for the legs and core without involving the shoulders. Modified push-ups on the knees can be less straining than regular push-ups, which might be too hard on the shoulders. Plank with lateral movements can help with core stability without needing to move the shoulders excessively.\n\nI should also include some core exercises, like Russian twists using bodyweight, which can be done without any equipment and are gentle on the shoulders. Bird-dog is another core exercise that strengthens the lower back and core without putting pressure on the shoulders.\n\nEach exercise should have clear instructions to ensure proper form, which is especially important to prevent further injury. The sets, repetitions, and rest times should be manageable for someone with intermediate experience but also considering their physical limitation.\n\nI'll structure the workout into seven exercises, each targeting different muscle groups or providing cardio benefits without overloading the shoulders. The plan should be balanced, ensuring that each session is effective for weight loss while being safe and considerate of the user's injury.\n\nI need to make sure the instructions are clear and that the user knows how to modify the exercises if they experience any pain. The rest periods should be adequate to allow recovery between sets and exercises, preventing overexertion.\n\nFinally, I'll compile all this information into a JSON structure that's easy to follow, with each exercise having all the necessary details like muscle group, type, instructions, timing, sets, reps, rest periods, weight, and calories burned. This will provide the user with a comprehensive and safe workout plan tailored to their needs and limitations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Treino para Emagrecimento com Cuidado ao Ombro\",\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Peso corporal - Abdominal Reto\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Abdômen\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se em uma superfície plana, com os joelhos dobrados e mãos atrás da cabeça.
