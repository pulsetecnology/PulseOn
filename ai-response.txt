  "output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the user's JSON data. Let's start by understanding the user's profile.\n\nThe user is a 50-year-old, weighing 85kg, and 180cm tall. Their main goal is to lose weight, and they have an intermediate level of experience. They can work out three times a week, and their available equipment includes bodyweight and others, but I should focus on what's available.\n\nOne important point is their physical restriction: tendinitis in the right shoulder, which is painful. So, I need to avoid exercises that strain the shoulders too much. That means no heavy overhead presses or anything that might aggravate the injury.\n\nSince the goal is weight loss, the plan should include a mix of cardio and strength training. Cardio helps burn calories, while strength training builds muscle, which also aids in metabolism. But given the shoulder issue, I'll have to modify some exercises.\n\nLooking at the equipment, bodyweight exercises are a good start. Push-ups can be modified to avoid putting too much strain on the shoulders. Maybe knee push-ups or incline push-ups. Alternatively, using other equipment like resistance bands could be useful if available.\n\nFor the lower body, squats and lunges are great. They work multiple muscle groups without putting too much strain on the shoulders. Planks are good for the core and don't involve the shoulders much, which is a plus.\n\nI should also include some cardio, like high knees or burpees, but modify them to be low-impact if necessary. Mountain climbers are another good option that don't require any equipment and can be done safely.\n\nConsidering the time, each workout should be around 45-60 minutes. I'll structure the plan to have a warm-up, followed by a circuit of exercises, and then a cool down. The circuit should include a mix of cardio and strength to keep the heart rate up and work on different muscle groups.\n\nI'll choose 7 exercises, making sure each targets different areas without overloading the shoulders. Each exercise should have clear instructions, the number of sets, reps, and rest periods. The rest periods should be adequate to allow recovery but not too long to keep the intensity up for weight loss.\n\nI'll also calculate the estimated calories burned for each exercise to ensure the workout is effective for weight loss. Each exercise's time will be specified, and the total workout should fit within the user's available time.\n\nFinally, I'll name the workout something motivating and ensure the plan is varied to keep the user engaged and prevent plateaus. The focus is on safety, effectiveness, and adherence to the user's constraints.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Treino para Emagrecimento com Cuidado ao Ombro\",\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Flexões de braço com joelhos no chão\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Peitoral\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Apoie os joelhos no chão, mantenha o core firme e faça flexões de braço, evitando movimento brusco nos ombros.\",\n      \"time\": 45,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 40\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Agachamentos com resistência corporal\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Mantenha as costas retas e desça até os quadris estarem paralelos ao chão, empurreatravés dos calcanhares.\",\n      \"time\": 45,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 55\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Prancha (Plank) lateral alternado\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Core\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Mantenha a prancha lateral por 20 segundos de cada lado, alternando.\",\n      \"time\": 45,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 1,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 30,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 30\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Puxadas com resistência (elástico ou corda)\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Costas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Mantenha o core firme e puxe a resistência em direção ao abdômen, evitando movimento brusco nos ombros.\",\n      \"time\": 45,\n      \"timeExec\": 25,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 45\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Joelhos altos (High Knees)\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Cardio\",\n      \"type\": \"Aeróbico\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Corra no lugar, levando os joelhos o mais alto possível, mantendo o ritmo constante.\",\n      \"time\": 45,\n      \"timeExec\": 40,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 1,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 60\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Elevação lateral de perna em pé\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique em pé, levante uma perna lateralmente, mantenha por 2 segundos e retorne.\",\n      \"time\": 45,\n      \"timeExec\": 25,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 35\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Burpees modificados (sem pulo)\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Full Body\",\n      \"type\": \"Força/Condicionamento\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Faça uma flexão, volte à posição de agachamento, empurre os pés para trás e retorne à posição inicial, evitando o pulo final.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 65\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
