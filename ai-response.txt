  "output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the user's JSON data. Let me start by analyzing the provided information.\n\nThe user is 50 years old, weighs 85kg, and is 180cm tall. His main goal is to gain muscle, which means the workout should focus on hypertrophy. He has an intermediate experience level, so the exercises shouldn't be too basic but also not overly complex. He works out six times a week, which is quite frequent, so I need to ensure the plan is balanced to avoid overtraining.\n\nHe has access to a gym, which is great because it allows for a variety of equipment. There are no physical restrictions mentioned, so I can include a wide range of exercises without worrying about injuries.\n\nGiven his goal, I should focus on compound movements that recruit multiple muscle groups, as they are efficient for building muscle. Since he's intermediate, I'll include some variation in the exercises to keep things interesting and prevent plateaus.\n\nI'll structure the workout into different days to target each major muscle group. For example, Day 1 can focus on chest and triceps, Day 2 on back and biceps, and so on. This ensures balanced development without overworking any single muscle group on consecutive days.\n\nI should also include some core and cardio elements to support overall fitness and prevent muscle imbalances. However, since the primary goal is muscle gain, cardio shouldn't be too intense or frequent.\n\nI need to make sure each exercise has clear instructions, appropriate sets and reps, and sufficient rest periods. For hypertrophy, higher reps with moderate weight are usually effective, so I'll suggest 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps for most exercises.\n\nVariety is important to keep the workouts engaging. So, I'll include different types of exercises like bench presses, pull-ups, rows, and isolation movements like flyes and curls. I'll also add some dynamic warm-up routines to prepare the muscles before each session.\n\nThe workout names should be catchy and descriptive, like \"Peito e Tríceps - Volumação Máxima\" to clearly indicate the focus area and intensity. The observations should be brief but motivating, encouraging the user to push through the sessions.\n\nI'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each exercise has all the necessary details and that the overall plan is well-organized. I'll double-check to make sure I'm not exceeding the 7-exercise limit per workout and that each day's plan is comprehensive yet manageable within the given time frame.\n\nFinally, I'll review everything to ensure it aligns with the user's goals, equipment availability, and experience level. Making sure the instructions are clear and the plan is varied enough to keep the user motivated throughout the six days.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Ganho Muscular Intenso\",\n  \"workoutObs\": \"Treino desafiador para hipertrofia muscular, aproveitando o acesso à academia.\",\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Supino inclinado com halteres\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Peitoral\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se no banco inclinado e empurre os halteres para cima, mantendo os cotovelos ligeiramente afastados.\",\n      \"time\": 90,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 8,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 75,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 15,\n      \"calories\": 70\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Puxada alta com corda\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Costas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, segure a corda nas extremidades e puxe a barra hacia o queixo, mantendo os cotovelos próximos ao corpo.\",\n      \"time\": 90,\n      \"timeExec\": 25,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 12,\n      \"calories\": 60\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Agachamento com barra\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Posicione a barra nas costas, abaixe o corpo mantendo as costas retas e volte à posição inicial.\",\n      \"time\": 120,\n      \"timeExec\": 40,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 8,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 90,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 120,\n      \"weight\": 25,\n      \"calories\": 100\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Crucifixo com halteres\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Peitoral\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se no banco reto e abra os braços lateralmente, mantendo os halteres estáveis.\",\n      \"time\": 90,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 10,\n      \"calories\": 50\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Rosca direta com barra\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Bíceps\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, segure a barra com pegada sobre e levante a barra até os ombros, mantendo os cotovelos colados ao corpo.\",\n      \"time\": 90,\n      \"timeExec\": 25,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 15,\n      \"calories\": 60\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Abdominal oblíquo\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Abdômen\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se no chão, levante o tronco e toque o ombro oposto com a mão, alternando os lados.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 30,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 60,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 30\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Corrida na esteira\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Cardiovascular\",\n      \"type\": \"Aeróbico\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Corra na esteira em intensidade moderada, mantendo uma cadência constante.\",\n      \"time\": 300,\n      \"timeExec\": 300,\n      \"series\": 1,\n      \"repetitions\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 0,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 150\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
