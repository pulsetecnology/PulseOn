  "output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the user's JSON data. Let me start by understanding the user's profile.\n\nThe user is 50 years old, weighs 85kg, and is 180cm tall. Their main goal is stress relief, which is important because it influences the type of exercises I should choose—probably something that promotes relaxation and isn't too intense.\n\nThey have a beginner's experience level, so the exercises should be simple and not too complicated. They can go to the gym three times a week, which is good for consistency. The available equipment is gym access, so I can include a variety of machines and free weights, but I need to be careful with the physical restriction.\n\nThe user has tendinitis in the right shoulder, so any exercise that involves heavy shoulder movements or strain should be avoided. That means no overhead presses, heavy lifting, or movements that could aggravate the injury. I should focus on lower impact exercises and maybe some core and leg work that doesn't involve the shoulders too much.\n\nLooking at the example JSON provided, it includes exercises like supino reto, which is a bench press. But since the user has a shoulder issue, maybe I should substitute that with something else. Alternatively, I can modify the exercise to be shoulder-friendly.\n\nWait, the example uses \"Supino reto com halteres\" which is a flat bench press with dumbbells. That might still be okay if done carefully, but I should consider if it's suitable. Alternatively, maybe a chest press machine could be better since it's more controlled and might put less strain on the shoulders.\n\nI should include a mix of cardio and strength training, but leaning more towards stress relief. Maybe some dynamic stretches or mobility exercises to start with. Also, core exercises are good for overall stability and can be done without straining the shoulders too much.\n\nConsidering the gym access, I can include exercises like leg press, which is great for legs without involving the shoulders. Maybe seated rows but with light weights to avoid shoulder strain. Also, exercises like the chest press machine can be included if they're comfortable for the user.\n\nI should also think about the duration and frequency. Each session is 60 minutes, three times a week. So I need to structure the workout to fit within that time, including warm-up, exercises, and cool down.\n\nFor the workout name, I want something catchy and modern, maybe something like \"Mind & Body Balance\" to reflect the stress relief goal.\n\nIn the workout observations, I should mention that the exercises are adapted to avoid shoulder strain and that the focus is on relaxation and overall well-being.\n\nNow, selecting the exercises. Let's see:\n\n1. Dynamic stretching to warm up, which is essential and gentle on the joints.\n2. Chest press machine to target the chest without heavy shoulder involvement.\n3. Seated row with a neutral grip to work the back muscles, being careful with the shoulder.\n4. Leg press for legs, which is a compound movement but shoulder-friendly.\n5. Core exercises like planks to build stability without straining the shoulders.\n6. Maybe some light cardio like stationary bike for stress relief.\n7. Static stretching to cool down and relax the muscles.\n\nI need to make sure each exercise has clear instructions, sets, reps, rest times, and weight suggestions. Also, the time each exercise takes and the calories burned should be included.\n\nI should avoid any exercises that could worsen the shoulder tendinitis. So, no overhead presses, no heavy lifting above the head, and no exercises that require external rotation or heavy load on the shoulders.\n\nLet me structure the workout plan accordingly, ensuring each exercise is safe and suitable for the user's condition. I'll also make sure the workout flows well, starting with a warm-up, moving through strength training, and ending with cardio and a cool down.\n\nFinally, I'll compile all this into the JSON format as specified, making sure each field is correctly filled and the workout name and observations are concise and motivating.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Mind & Body Balance\",\n  \"workoutObs\": \"Treino adaptado para alívio de estresse, com exercícios que evitam sobrecarga no ombro direito.
