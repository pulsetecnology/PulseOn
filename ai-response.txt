  "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the user's JSON data. Let me start by analyzing the input.\n\nThe user is a 50-year-old male, weighing 85 kg and 180 cm tall. His goal is to gain muscle, which means the workout should focus on hypertrophy. He's classified as advanced, so the exercises can be more challenging and varied. He has access to a gym, which is great because we can include a variety of equipment.\n\nSince he's advanced, I should include compound movements to target multiple muscle groups efficiently. The weekly frequency is 3 times, so the plan should be split into different days, but since the output only needs one workout, I'll focus on a full-body or upper/lower split.\n\nLooking at the available equipment, gym access allows for barbells, dumbbells, machines, etc. I should choose exercises that are effective and safe, considering he has no physical restrictions.\n\nThe example output uses 7 exercises, so I'll aim for that. I'll include a mix of compound and isolation exercises to ensure comprehensive muscle engagement. For each exercise, I'll set appropriate sets, reps, and rest periods. Since the goal is muscle gain, higher reps with moderate weight might be better, but for advanced lifters, lower reps with heavier weights can also be effective.\n\nI should also vary the exercises to keep the workout engaging and prevent plateaus. Maybe include some dynamic movements to keep it interesting. The workout name should be catchy and descriptive, avoiding the word \"Treino.\" The observation should be a brief, motivating explanation of the workout's focus.\n\nNow, structuring the workout: start with a compound lift like the deadlift, then move to bench press, pull-ups, overhead press, bent-over rows, bicep curls, and finish with leg presses. This covers all major muscle groups. Each exercise will have 4 sets, with reps varying between 6-12 to balance strength and hypertrophy. Rest periods are 60-90 seconds between sets and 90 seconds between exercises.\n\nI'll make sure the instructions are clear and the weights are challenging but safe for an advanced lifter. The calories burned are just estimates based on the intensity and duration.\n\nFinally, the workout name should reflect the focus on muscle gain, something like \"Massa Muscular: Força Total.\" The observation will highlight the full-body approach and the balance between strength and hypertrophy.\n\nI think that covers all the requirements. Let me put it all together in the JSON format as specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Massa Muscular: Força Total\",\n  \"workoutObs\": \"Treino intensivo para ganho de massa muscular, focado em movimentos compostos e isolados para estimular todos os grupos musculares.
