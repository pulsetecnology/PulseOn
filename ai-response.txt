  "output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a personalized workout plan for a 50-year-old user who wants to gain muscle. He has a gym membership but had a forearm fracture with a plate and screws, so I need to avoid any exercises that might strain his arms or wrists.\n\nFirst, his main goal is muscle gain, so I should focus on compound movements that work multiple muscle groups. Since he's a beginner, the exercises should be foundational but safe.\n\nHe can't do any heavy lifting that involves the forearm, so I'll avoid things like bench presses or any exercise that requires gripping heavy weights. Maybe seated chest presses with a machine would be better since it doesn't strain the wrists as much.\n\nFor the legs, squats are great but I should ensure they're done with support to minimize forearm stress. Maybe using a machine for leg presses would be safer.\n\nHis upper body needs attention without overloading the arms. Lateral raises can be done with lighter weights, and seated rows are good for the back without heavy gripping.\n\nCore exercises are important, so seated crunches or leg raises on a machine would work without putting pressure on the arms.\n\nI should include some cardio for overall fitness, maybe cycling since it's low impact and easy on the joints.\n\nI need to structure the workout plan with these considerations, making sure each exercise is safe and effective. Also, the workout name should be catchy and the observations should be encouraging.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Força e Volume com Segurança\",\n  \"workoutObs\": \"Treino equilibrado para ganho de massa muscular, respeitando as restrições físicas.\",\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Supino inclinado com halteres leves\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Peitoral\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se no banco inclinado, segure halteres leves e faça movimentos controlados, evitando esticar muito os antebraços.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 8,\n      \"calories\": 45\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Puxada alta com corda\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Costas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, segure a corda com as mãos afastadas, puxe a corda em direção ao queixo e mantenha a postura ereta.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 10,\n      \"calories\": 50\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Agachamento parcial com apoio\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, desça um pouco em agachamento, mantendo as costas retas e usando um apoio para estabilidade.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 40\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Elevação lateral com halteres leves\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Ombros\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, levante os halteres levemente para os lados, mantendo os cotovelos ligeiramente dobrados.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 6,\n      \"calories\": 35\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Bicicleta ergométrica\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Cardio\",\n      \"type\": \"Aeróbico\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Caminhe na bicicleta ergométrica com resistência moderada, mantendo uma cadência constante.\",\n      \"time\": 300,\n      \"timeExec\": 300,\n      \"series\": 1,\n      \"repetitions\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 0,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 80\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
