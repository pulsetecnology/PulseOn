  "output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the user's JSON data. Let me start by analyzing the provided information.\n\nThe user is 50 years old, weighs 85kg, and is 180cm tall. Their main goal is to lose weight, which means the workout should focus on burning calories and increasing metabolism. They have an intermediate experience level, so the exercises shouldn't be too basic but also not overly complex.\n\nThey have access to a gym, which is great because it allows for a variety of equipment. There are no physical restrictions mentioned, so I can include a range of exercises without worrying about injuries.\n\nThe workout frequency is three times a week, and each session should last about 60 minutes. I need to make sure the plan is efficient within this time frame. Since the goal is weight loss, I'll incorporate a mix of cardio and strength training to burn calories and build muscle, which helps boost metabolism.\n\nLet me think about the exercises. For a full-body approach, I'll include compound movements that work multiple muscle groups. Squats are excellent for the legs and core. Lunges can target the legs and also get the heart rate up. Push-ups are a classic for the chest and triceps. I'll add some core exercises like plank rows to engage the core and improve stability.\n\nIncluding some cardio elements like jump squats and burpees will help with calorie burn. I should also add some lateral raises to work the shoulders and improve posture. Each exercise should have a specific number of sets, reps, and rest periods to ensure effectiveness without overtraining.\n\nI need to structure the workout so that it flows well, allowing for rest periods between exercises and sets. The name should be catchy and reflect the purpose, something like \"Full Body Ignition\" to signify energy and movement.\n\nNow, putting it all together, I'll list each exercise with its details, making sure the total time adds up to 60 minutes. I'll calculate the calories burned for each exercise to provide a clear picture. This plan should help the user achieve their weight loss goal while maintaining muscle mass and improving overall fitness.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Full Body Ignition\",\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Agachamento com halteres\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, afaste os pés na largura dos ombros, abaixe o corpo mantendo as costas retas e empurre os halteres para os quadris.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 15,\n      \"calories\": 70\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Elevação lateral com halteres\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Ombros\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, mantenha os joelhos ligeiramente dobrados, elevação os halteres lateralmente até a altura dos ombros.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 10,\n      \"calories\": 45\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Flexão de braços com suporte\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Peitoral\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Coloque as mãos em dois apoios, mantenha os pés no chão, abaixe o corpo até os braços dobrarem 90 graus e empurre de volta.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 25,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 55\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Prancha com remada\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Core\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Mantenha a posição de prancha, puxe um halter para a altura das costelas, alternando os lados.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 8,\n      \"calories\": 40\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Pulo agachado\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas\",\n      \"type\": \"Cardio\",\n      \"instructions\": \"De pé, agache-se levemente, depois pule para cima o mais alto possível.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 40,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 60\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Burpees\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Full Body\",\n      \"type\": \"Cardio\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Comece de pé, faça uma flexão para tocar os pés, dê uma volta para trás, faça um pulo para cima.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 35,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 65\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
