  "output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a personalized workout plan for the user with ID 1. Let me start by reviewing the JSON input provided.\n\nThe user is 50 years old, weighs 85 kg, and is 180 cm tall. Their main fitness goal is to lose weight, which means the workout should focus on burning calories and possibly building some muscle to increase metabolism. They have an intermediate experience level, so the exercises shouldn't be too basic but also not overly complex.\n\nThe user can train three times a week, which is manageable. They have access to bodyweight and other equipment, but I should be cautious since they have a shoulder tendinitis on the right side, which is painful. So, I need to avoid any exercises that might strain the shoulder, especially the right one.\n\nLooking at the physical restriction, tendinitis in the right shoulder means I should avoid movements that involve heavy lifting, overhead presses, or anything that might cause strain. So, exercises like overhead presses, heavy shoulder rotations, or anything that requires raising the arm above shoulder height on the right side should be excluded.\n\nGiven that, I'll focus on lower body and core exercises, as well as some upper body exercises that don't involve the right shoulder. Since they can use bodyweight and other equipment, maybe incorporating some resistance bands could be useful without putting too much strain on the shoulders.\n\nThe user's objective is weight loss, so the workout should have a mix of cardio and strength training. Each session should aim to burn calories while maintaining or building some muscle mass.\n\nConsidering the available equipment, bodyweight exercises are a great option. I can include squats, lunges, planks, push-ups (but modified to avoid shoulder strain), and other similar exercises. Maybe using a chair or bench for tricep dips could be useful, but I need to ensure it doesn't affect the shoulder.\n\nI should also think about the duration and frequency. Each workout should be around 60 minutes, with a mix of warm-up, main exercises, and cool-down. Since they train three times a week, I'll plan three different workouts, each targeting different muscle groups or focusing on different aspects like cardio and strength.\n\nFor each exercise, I'll specify the number of sets, repetitions, and rest periods. Since they're intermediate, I can include more sets and reps than a beginner, but not too intense. Also, the rest periods should be adequate to allow recovery without making the workout too long.\n\nLet me outline the three workouts:\n\n1. Lower Body Focus: Squats, Romanian deadlifts, calf raises, and side plank for core.\n2. Upper Body Focus (avoiding right shoulder): Push-ups with shoulder precautions, tricep dips using a chair, lateral raises with light weights, and face pulls with a resistance band.\n3. Full Body Cardio: Jump squats, mountain climbers, plank jacks, and Russian twists for core.\n\nEach workout should start with a warm-up and end with a cool-down. I'll make sure to include dynamic stretches to prevent injury and static stretches to aid recovery.\n\nI also need to ensure that the exercises are varied to keep the user motivated. Including different types of movements, like squats, lunges, jumps, and core work, will make the workouts engaging and comprehensive.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the JSON output to include each workout with specific instructions, sets, reps, and rest times. I'll make sure to calculate the calories burned for each exercise to help the user track their progress.\n\nI should also consider the user's age and possible mobility issues. Exercises should be modifiable if needed, but since they're intermediate, the plan should be challenging yet safe.\n\nAlright, putting it all together, the workout plan should be balanced, respect the physical restriction, and align with the user's weight loss goal. Each exercise is chosen to maximize calorie burn and muscle engagement without straining the right shoulder.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Treino para Emagrecimento com Cuidado ao Ombro\",\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Agachamento (Squat)\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas e Glúteos\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, separe os pés na largura dos ombros, dobre os joelhos e desça até que os quadris fiquem na mesma altura dos joelhos.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 70\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Puxada Curvada com Corda\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Costas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Segure a corda com as mãos na altura dos ombros, puxe a corda para os lados até que os cotovelos estejam atrás, mantendo os braços baixos.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 5,\n      \"calories\": 45\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Prancha (Plank) com Elevação de Perna\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Core\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de bruços, apoie-se nos antebraços e elevação uma perna, mantenha a posição por 20 segundos e alterne as pernas.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 20,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 30\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Flexão de Joelhos com Suporte\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, segure em um apoio estável, dobre os joelhos e puxe o corpo para cima.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 25,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 50\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Corrida no Lugar com Alto Impacto\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Geral\",\n      \"type\": \"Aeróbico\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, comece a correr no lugar, levantando os joelhos o mais alto possível.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 45,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 80\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Abdominal Oblicuo\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Abdômen\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se de lado, levante o tronco e as pernas, mantenha por 2 segundos e repita do outro lado.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 40\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Alongamento Geral\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Geral\",\n      \"type\": \"Alongamento\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Realize alongamentos para grandes grupos musculares, como pernas, costas e ombros, mantendo cada posição por 20-30 segundos.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 0,\n      \"series\": 1,\n      \"repetitions\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 0,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 10\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
