  "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a personalized workout plan for a user based on the provided JSON. Let me start by understanding the user's profile.\n\nThe user is 50 years old, weighs 85 kg, and is 180 cm tall. Their main goal is to gain muscle, which means the workout should focus on hypertrophy and strength. They have an advanced experience level, so the exercises can be more intense and varied.\n\nThey have access to a gym, which is great because that opens up a lot of equipment options. There are no physical restrictions mentioned, so I don't need to worry about injuries or limitations.\n\nThe weekly frequency is 3 times, and each session should last about 90 minutes. Since they're advanced, I can structure each workout to target different muscle groups to allow for recovery and maximize growth.\n\nLooking at the example JSON, it includes exercises with specific details like muscle group, type, instructions, time, series, reps, rest periods, weight, and calories. I need to follow that structure but make sure each exercise is suitable for muscle gain.\n\nI should aim for a mix of compound movements and some isolation exercises. For example, squats and deadlifts are great for multiple muscle groups, while bench presses and pull-ups target specific areas. Including some core work will also help with overall stability and muscle balance.\n\nI need to ensure that the rest periods are adequate for an advanced lifter, allowing enough time to recover between sets but not so long that it disrupts the workout flow. Weights should be challenging but manageable for the given reps.\n\nLet me think of each exercise:\n\n1. Back Squat: Works legs and core, essential for lower body strength.\n2. Deadlift: Another compound lift for overall strength and multiple muscle groups.\n3. Bench Press: Targets the chest and triceps.\n4. Pull-Up: Great for back and arm development.\n5. Dumbbell Shoulder Press: For shoulder hypertrophy.\n6. Barbell Curls: Targets the biceps.\n7. Plank: Core stability, which is important for all lifts.\n\nEach exercise should have 4 sets with reps around 8-12 to focus on hypertrophy. Rest periods between sets should be around 90 seconds, and a bit longer between exercises. The weights should be adjusted based on the user's capacity, but I'll set them to challenging levels.\n\nI should also give the workout a catchy name that reflects its purpose, like \"Força Máxima: Hypertrofia Completa.\" It sounds strong and indicates a full-body hypertrophy focus.\n\nNow, I'll structure all this into the JSON format, making sure each exercise is detailed correctly with all the necessary properties. I'll also calculate the calories burned for each exercise, ensuring they're realistic based on the user's weight and exercise intensity.\n\nFinally, I'll review everything to make sure there are no physical restrictions being violated and that the workout aligns with the user's goal of gaining muscle. The plan should be balanced, hitting all major muscle groups, and allowing for proper recovery between sessions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Força Máxima: Hypertrofia Completa\",\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Agachamento com barra\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Posicione a barra nas costas, agache mantendo o peito erguido e volte à posição inicial.\",\n      \"time\": 90,\n      \"timeExec\": 40,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 8,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 90,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 120,\n      \"weight\": 60,\n      \"calories\": 120\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Puxada alta com barra\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Costas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Puxe a barra para a altura da cintura, mantendo os cotovelos próximos ao corpo.\",\n      \"time\": 90,\n      \"timeExec\": 35,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 8,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 90,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 120,\n      \"weight\": 50,\n      \"calories\": 110\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Supino inclinado com halteres\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Peitoral\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se no banco inclinado e empurre os halteres para cima.\",\n      \"time\": 90,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 90,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 120,\n      \"weight\": 25,\n      \"calories\": 100\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Remada curvada com barra\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Costas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Mantenha a postura ereta, puxe a barra até a altura do umbigo.\",\n      \"time\": 90,\n      \"timeExec\": 35,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 8,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 90,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 120,\n      \"weight\": 45,\n      \"calories\": 105\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Elevação lateral com halteres\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Ombros\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Mantenha os braços estendidos e elevação os halteres até a altura dos ombros.\",\n      \"time\": 90,\n      \"timeExec\": 25,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 18,\n      \"calories\": 90\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Tríceps pulley\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Tríceps\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Empurre a barra para baixo, estendendo totally os braços.\",\n      \"time\": 90,\n      \"timeExec\": 25,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 20,\n      \"calories\": 85\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Prancha\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Core\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Mantenha o corpo reto, apoiando-se em antebraços e pontas dos pés.\",\n      \"time\": 90,\n      \"timeExec\": 40,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 120,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 70\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
