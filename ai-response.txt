  "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the user's JSON data. Let me start by understanding the user's profile.\n\nThe user is a 50-year-old male, weighing 85 kg and 180 cm tall. His main goal is to lose weight, and he has an intermediate level of experience. He works out three times a week and has access to a gym. There are no physical restrictions mentioned, which is great because it means we can include a variety of exercises without worrying about injuries.\n\nSince his goal is weight loss, the workout should focus on both cardiovascular exercises and strength training to burn calories and build muscle, which helps increase metabolism. The gym access means we can use equipment like treadmills, stationary bikes, and various machines or free weights.\n\nI should structure the workout to cover different muscle groups each day to ensure overall fitness and to prevent overtraining any specific area. Each session should start with a warm-up to get the heart rate up and prepare the muscles. For the main workout, I'll include a mix of cardio and strength exercises. Finally, a cool-down with stretching will help prevent soreness and improve flexibility.\n\nLet me plan each day:\n\n1. **Cardio & Full Body Strength:**\n   - Start with 10 minutes on the stationary bike for a dynamic warm-up.\n   - Then, circuit training with exercises like burpees, kettlebell swings, and mountain climbers to keep the heart rate high and work multiple muscle groups.\n   - Include some strength exercises like pull-ups or lat pulldowns, and dumbbell squats to target major muscles.\n   - Finish with core exercises like planks and Russian twists to engage the core and improve stability.\n\n2. **Lower Body & Core:**\n   - Warm-up on the treadmill for 10 minutes.\n   - Focus on lower body with leg press, lunges, and deadlifts to build strength and endurance.\n   - Include core exercises like hanging leg raises and side planks to target the abs and obliques.\n   - Cool down with stretching focusing on hamstrings, quads, and lower back.\n\n3. **Upper Body & Cardio:**\n   - Warm-up with rowing machine for 10 minutes.\n   - Strength exercises like bench press, push-ups, and lateral raises to work the chest, shoulders, and triceps.\n   - Include some cardio like jump rope to keep the heart rate up.\n   - Core exercises like bicycle crunches and leg raises to engage the abs.\n   - Stretch the upper body muscles like chest, shoulders, and triceps.\n\nI need to make sure each exercise has clear instructions, sets, reps, and rest periods. Since the user is intermediate, the weights and reps can be challenging but manageable. The rest periods should be adequate to allow recovery between sets but not too long to keep the intensity.\n\nI'll name each workout day something catchy and descriptive, like \"Combustão Total,\" \"Força e Definição,\" and \"Energia Máxima\" to keep it motivating and in Portuguese as per the instructions.\n\nFinally, I'll structure each exercise in the JSON format, ensuring all required fields are filled accurately, including muscle groups, exercise type, instructions, time, weight, etc. I'll make sure the total number of exercises doesn't exceed seven as per the rules.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Combustão Total\",\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Bicicleta ergométrica\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Cardiovascular\",\n      \"type\": \"Aeróbico\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Comece com uma marcha constante moderada.\",\n      \"timeExec\": 600,\n      \"series\": 1,\n      \"repetitions\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 120\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Burpees\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Full Body\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Faça uma flexão, seguida por um pulo para trás e um pulo para frente, finalizando com um pulo alto.\",\n      \"time\": 0,\n      \"timeExec\": 0,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 90\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Puxadas fechadas\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Costas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Puxe a barra para baixo até os ombros, mantendo o peito aberto.\",\n      \"time\": 0,\n      \"timeExec\": 0,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 20,\n      \"calories\": 70\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Agachamentos com halteres\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Mantenha as costas retas e desça até os quadris estarem paralelos ao chão.\",\n      \"time\": 0,\n      \"timeExec\": 0,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 15,\n      \"calories\": 80\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Prancha inclinada\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Core\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Mantenha a posição por 30 segundos, mantendo o corpo reto.\",\n      \"time\": 0,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 30,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 20\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Elevações laterais\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Ombros\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Levante os halteres até os ombros, mantendo os braços ligeiramente flexionados.\",\n      \"time\": 0,\n      \"timeExec\": 0,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 10,\n      \"calories\": 40\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Alongamentos gerais\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Full Body\",\n      \"type\": \"Alongamento\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Alongue cada músculo trabalhado, mantendo cada posição por 20-30 segundos.\",\n      \"timeExec\": 300,\n      \"series\": 1,\n      \"repetitions\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 0,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 0\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
