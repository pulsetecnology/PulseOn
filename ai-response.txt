  "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a personalized workout plan for a user based on their JSON profile. Let me start by understanding the details provided.\n\nThe user is 50 years old, weighs 85kg, and is 180cm tall. Their main goal is to gain muscle, which means the focus should be on strength training and hypertrophy. They have a beginner's experience level, so the exercises should be foundational and not too complex.\n\nLooking at their physical restrictions, they had an accident where they fractured their forearm and have a plate with 8 screws. It's been 5 months, so I need to make sure the exercises don't put strain on the forearm or wrist. That means avoiding any heavy lifting with the wrists, like barbell exercises, and focusing on lower body or alternative upper body exercises that don't require gripping or heavy loads on the arms.\n\nThe user has access to a gym, which is great because it offers a variety of equipment. However, considering their forearm injury, I should avoid machines or exercises that require gripping, like pull-ups or rows that involve holding weights with the hands. \n\nTheir weekly frequency is 3 times, so the plan should be efficient but not overloading. Each session should target different muscle groups to allow recovery. Since they're a beginner, the plan should start with manageable weights and progress gradually.\n\nThe workout should include lower body exercises since those are generally safer with the given injury. For the upper body, I can include exercises that don't require heavy gripping, like chest presses using machines where the grip isn't an issue or shoulder presses with lighter weights.\n\nI need to make sure each exercise is modified to accommodate their injury. For example, using a leg press instead of squats if balance is an issue, but since they can do squats, maybe bodyweight or with light weights. For the upper body, maybe seated chest presses with dumbbells where the grip isn't too tight, or using machines that don't require heavy gripping.\n\nI should also include core exercises that don't strain the forearm, like seated abdominal crunches or planks that don't require putting too much pressure on the wrists.\n\nThe workout name should be catchy and relevant, maybe something like \"Força e Equilíbrio\" to emphasize strength and balance, considering their injury and the need to focus on overall stability.\n\nEach exercise should have clear instructions to ensure proper form, avoiding any movements that could strain the forearm. Rest times between sets and exercises should be adequate to prevent overexertion, especially since they're just starting out.\n\nI'll structure the workout plan with 7 exercises, each targeting different muscle groups, ensuring a full-body approach without overcomplicating things. The calories burned and weights should be adjusted to their fitness level, starting light and increasing as they progress.\n\nFinally, the workout observations should be encouraging, emphasizing the focus on strength and balance while being careful with their injury. It should motivate them to stick to the plan and gradually build up their muscle mass safely.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Força e Equilíbrio\",\n  \"workoutObs\": \"Treino focado em ganho de massa muscular, respeitando as restrições físicas e priorizando movimentos seguros e controlados.\",\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Agachamento com peso corporal\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, afaste os pés na largura dos ombros, mantenha o peito erguido e faça um agachamento lento e controlado, abaixando até os joelhos formarem um ângulo de 90 graus.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 45\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Supino inclinado com halteres leves\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Peitoral\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se no banco inclinado, segure os halteres com um grip leve e empurre para cima, mantendo os cotovelos ligeiramente afastados.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 25,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 8,\n      \"calories\": 50\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Puxada alta com corda\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Costas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, segure a corda com as mãos na altura dos ombros, puxe a corda para cima na direção da clavícula, mantendo os cotovelos próximos ao corpo.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 25,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 10,\n      \"calories\": 55\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Crucifixo com halteres\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Peitoral\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se no banco reto, estenda os braços lateralmente na altura dos ombros, mantenha os cotovelos ligeiramente flexionados e faça um movimento de abertura e fechamento.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 25,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 8,\n      \"calories\": 50\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Extensão de pernas\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Sentado na máquina, fixe os pés na barra, estenda as pernas completamente e volte à posição inicial de forma controlada.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 25,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 12,\n      \"calories\": 55\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Abdominal sentado\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Abdômen\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Sentado no aparelho, fixe os pés na barra, incline o tronco para frente, contraindo o abdômen e retornando à posição inicial.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 25,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 10,\n      \"calories\": 45\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Placa lateral\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Ombros\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, leve os braços lateralmente à altura dos ombros, mantenha os cotovelos levemente flexionados e segure por 5 segundos.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 40\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
