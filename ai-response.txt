  "output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the user's JSON data. Let me start by understanding the user's profile.\n\nThe user is 50 years old, weighs 85kg, and is 180cm tall. His main goal is to gain muscle, which means the workout should focus on hypertrophy. He's a beginner, so the exercises should be foundational and not too complex. He has access to a gym, which is great because we can use various equipment.\n\nHowever, there's a physical restriction: he had a forearm fracture with a plate and screws 5 months ago. That means we need to avoid any exercises that put strain on the wrists or forearms. So, no heavy gripping, bending, or exercises that require significant wrist movement.\n\nGiven his weekly frequency of 3 days, the plan should be split into upper, lower, and full body days or a push-pull-legs split. But considering his injury, it's better to avoid certain movements. Let's go with a 3-day split focusing on major muscle groups without stressing the forearms.\n\nLooking at the example JSON, each exercise has specific details. I'll need to include muscle group, type, instructions, time, series, reps, rest periods, weight, and calories. Since he's a beginner, the instructions need to be clear to prevent injury.\n\nFor the upper body, we can use machines that don't require heavy gripping, like the chest press machine. Shoulder press is okay if it's done with a neutral grip. For legs, squats and leg press are good. For the back, seated row with a neutral grip is suitable.\n\nI'll create a workout name that's catchy and reflects the focus, like \"Full Body Strength & Muscle.\" The observation should explain the workout's purpose briefly.\n\nEach exercise should be modified to accommodate his forearm injury. For example, using a neutral grip on rows and avoiding heavy barbell exercises. I'll choose 7 exercises in total, spread across the three days, ensuring each major muscle group is targeted without overcomplicating things.\n\nI need to make sure the weights are manageable for a beginner, starting around 10kg and increasing as he progresses. Rest times should be adequate to allow recovery but not too long to keep the workout efficient.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the JSON with all the necessary fields, ensuring it's clear and easy to follow for the user. The instructions will guide him on proper form to avoid any strain on his forearms.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Full Body Strength & Muscle\",\n  \"workoutObs\": \"Treino equilibrado para ganho de massa muscular, respeitando as restrições físicas.\",\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Supino Inclinado com Halteres\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Peitoral\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se no banco inclinado e empurre os halteres para cima, mantendo os cotovelos ligeiramente afastados.
