  "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the user's JSON data. Let me start by carefully analyzing the input to understand all the requirements and constraints.\n\nFirst, the user's ID is 1, which isn't too relevant for the workout plan, but it's good to note. The user is 50 years old and weighs 85 kg, with a height of 180 cm. Their main fitness goal is to lose weight, which means the workout should focus on burning calories and possibly building lean muscle to increase metabolism.\n\nThe user has an intermediate experience level, so the exercises shouldn't be too basic, but also not overly complicated. They have access to a gym, which is great because it offers a variety of equipment. However, there's a physical restriction: tendinitis in the right shoulder, which causes pain. This is crucial because I need to avoid any exercises that might exacerbate the injury, especially those involving heavy shoulder movements or overhead presses.\n\nThe weekly frequency is three times, so the plan should be spread out to allow for adequate rest and recovery. Each session's duration isn't specified, but considering the exercises and rest periods, it should be manageable within an hour or so.\n\nLooking at the example JSON provided, it includes a workout name and a list of exercises with specific details. My plan should follow the same structure but tailored to the user's needs.\n\nGiven the shoulder issue, I should avoid exercises like overhead presses, lateral raises, or anything that puts strain on the shoulder joint. Instead, focus on lower body, core, and some chest or back exercises that don't require heavy shoulder involvement.\n\nFor the lower body, squats and lunges are great for burning calories and building muscle. They can be done with body weight or with light weights to avoid putting too much strain on the shoulders when holding weights.\n\nCore exercises are essential for overall stability and can help with posture, which might indirectly support the shoulder. Plank variations are good because they don't require any equipment and are gentle on the shoulders.\n\nFor the chest, incline push-ups can be modified to avoid deep shoulder movement. Using a stability ball might help reduce strain on the shoulder compared to traditional push-ups.\n\nWhen it comes to cardio, rowing is excellent because it works the back and arms without heavy shoulder rotation. It's also a good calorie burner. However, I need to ensure that the rowing motion doesn't aggravate the tendinitis, so maybe using a machine where the movement is more controlled.\n\nI should include a mix of strength training and cardio to help with weight loss. Each exercise should have clear instructions, focusing on proper form to prevent further injury. The weights should be manageable, not too heavy, to avoid putting unnecessary strain on the shoulders.\n\nRest periods are important, especially with a shoulder injury. Adequate rest between sets and exercises will help in recovery and prevent overexertion.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the workout plan with exercises that are effective for weight loss, consider the user's intermediate level, avoid shoulder strain, and fit within the available equipment at the gym. Each exercise will have specific instructions, sets, reps, and rest times to ensure safety and effectiveness.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Emagrecimento Funcional com Proteção ao Ombro\",\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Agachamento com Barra Curva\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Segure a barra curva com as mãos na largura dos ombros, mantenha a coluna reta e desça até os quadris estarem abaixo do nível dos joelhos.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 15,\n      \"calories\": 70\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Puxada Curvada com Corda\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Costas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Mantenha o tronco reto, puxe a corda em direção ao abdômen, mantendo os cotovelos próximos ao corpo.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 10,\n      \"calories\": 60\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Prancha com Elevação de Quadril\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Core\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Mantenha a posição de prancha, elevando o quadril lentamente, segurando por 2 segundos no topo.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 40\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Supino Inclinado com Halteres\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Peitoral\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se no banco inclinado, empurre os halteres para cima, mantendo os cotovelos ligeiramente afastados.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 12,\n      \"calories\": 50\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Remada Baixa com Barra\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Costas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Mantenha a coluna neutra, puxe a barra até a altura dos quadris, contraindo as costas.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 15,\n      \"calories\": 65\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Elevação Lateral de Pernas\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se de lado, elevando a perna superior sem mover o quadril.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 45\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Corrida na Esteira\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Cardio\",\n      \"type\": \"Aeróbico\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Corra na esteira com inclinação moderada, mantendo uma velocidade constante.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 300,\n      \"series\": 1,\n      \"repetitions\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 0,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 120\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
