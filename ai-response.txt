  "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the user's JSON data. Let me start by understanding the user's profile.\n\nThe user is 50 years old, weighs 85kg, and is 180cm tall. Their main goal is to lose weight, and they have an intermediate level of experience. They can work out three times a week, which is manageable.\n\nLooking at the equipment, they only have bodyweight and \"others.\" Since \"others\" isn't specific, I'll assume they might have basic equipment like a resistance band or maybe a chair, but I'll focus mostly on bodyweight exercises to be safe.\n\nThe physical restriction is tendinite in the right shoulder, which causes pain. That means I need to avoid any exercises that might strain the shoulder, like overhead presses, heavy lifting, or movements that involve repetitive shoulder stress.\n\nGiven the weight loss goal, the plan should focus on full-body exercises that burn calories, possibly with some cardio elements. Since they have shoulder issues, I need to pick exercises that don't involve heavy shoulder use. Maybe bodyweight exercises that work the lower body and core, which can help burn calories without stressing the shoulder.\n\nLet me think about the exercises. Squats are great for legs and can be modified if needed. Lunges too, but they might put some stress on the front shoulder if using weights, so maybe bodyweight lunges instead. Push-ups are a classic, but since they have shoulder issues, maybe incline push-ups using a chair to reduce strain. Planks are good for the core and don't involve the shoulders much. For cardio, mountain climbers or jumping jacks can get the heart rate up without using the shoulders. Glute bridges are good for the lower body and core.\n\nNow, structuring the workout. Each session should have a warm-up, maybe 5 minutes of light cardio like walking or jumping jacks. Then, the main exercises. I'll include 7 exercises, as per the instructions, each with proper sets, reps, and rest times. Since the shoulder is an issue, I'll avoid any exercise that might worsen it.\n\nLet me assign the exercises with proper parameters. For each exercise, I'll set the number of series, repetitions, rest periods, and calories burned. I'll also include instructions to ensure they're done correctly without straining the shoulder.\n\nFinally, I'll make sure the plan is balanced, hitting all major muscle groups without overloading the shoulders. The plan should be motivating and safe, helping the user reach their weight loss goal without causing injury.\n\nI think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each exercise is appropriate and the plan is varied and effective.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Treino Full Body para Emagrecimento com Cuidado no Ombro\",\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Agachamento\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, afaste os pés na largura dos ombros, dobre os joelhos e abaixe o corpo mantendo as costas retas.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 40\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Puxada de perna com resistência\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Costas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se de bruços, estenda os braços à frente e puxe os joelhos em direção ao peito, mantendo os quadris no chão.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 35\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Prancha\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Core\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique em posição de prancha, mantenha os ombros alinhados com os punhos e o corpo reto, segurando a posição.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 1,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 20\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Pulada de quadril\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Glúteos\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se de costas, dobre os joelhos, afaste os pés e levante os quadris mantendo a coluna neutra.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 40\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Montanha\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Cardio\",\n      \"type\": \"Aeróbico\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique em posição de prancha, leve os joelhos alternadamente em direção ao peito, mantendo o ritmo acelerado.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 50\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Puxada de perna invertida com resistência\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Costas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, dobre o joelho e puxe a perna para trás, mantendo o equilíbrio.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 30\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Elevação lateral de perna\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, afaste os pés na largura dos ombros, levante uma perna lateralmente e mantenha por alguns segundos.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 35\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
