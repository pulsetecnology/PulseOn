  "output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the user's JSON data. Let me start by understanding the user's profile.\n\nThe user is 50 years old, weighs 85kg, and is 180cm tall. Their main goal is to lose weight, which means the workout should focus on burning calories and possibly building some muscle to increase metabolism. They have an intermediate experience level, so the exercises shouldn't be too basic but also not overly complicated.\n\nThe user has tendinitis in their right shoulder, which is painful. I need to avoid any exercises that might strain the shoulder, like heavy overhead presses or movements that involve repetitive shoulder stress. So, exercises like lateral raises, overhead presses, or anything that requires lifting weights above the head should be excluded.\n\nThey have bodyweight and \"others\" as available equipment. \"Others\" could mean resistance bands or maybe light dumbbells, but since the shoulder is an issue, I should prioritize bodyweight exercises or those that don't require heavy lifting. Resistance bands could be useful here as they are gentle on the joints.\n\nThe weekly frequency is 3 times, so the workout plan should be structured to allow adequate rest days. Each session should be efficient, targeting different muscle groups to promote overall fitness without overtaxing any particular area, especially the shoulders.\n\nLooking at the example JSON, each exercise has specific details. I need to include muscle groups, type (strength or cardio), instructions, time, series, reps, rest periods, weight, and calories burned. Since the user can't do heavy shoulder work, I'll focus on lower body, core, and some chest exercises that don't involve the shoulders too much.\n\nFor the warm-up, a dynamic routine using bodyweight like high knees and arm circles (but being careful with the shoulder) would be good. Then, I can include exercises like glute bridges to target the lower body without involving the shoulders. Mountain climbers are great for cardio and don't strain the shoulders. Plank variations can help with core strength, and bird-dog is another core exercise that's gentle on the shoulders. For the chest, maybe a modified push-up if the shoulder allows, or perhaps using a resistance band for chest presses. Finally, a cool-down stretch focusing on the lower body and back would be beneficial.\n\nI should make sure each exercise has clear instructions, appropriate sets and reps, and enough rest time. Since the user is intermediate, the number of sets and reps should challenge them but not overdo it, considering their injury.\n\nI also need to calculate the calories burned for each exercise, which can be approximate based on the duration and intensity. The total workout time should be around 45-60 minutes, including warm-up and cool-down.\n\nLet me structure the workout plan with these considerations in mind, ensuring each exercise is safe and effective for the user's condition and goals.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Treino Funcional para Emagrecimento com Cuidado ao Ombro\",\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Aquecimento Dinâmico\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Geral\",\n      \"type\": \"Aeróbico\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Realizar movimentos dinâmicos como joelhos altos, polichinelos e círculos de braço (com cuidado no ombro).\",\n      \"time\": 300,\n      \"timeExec\": 300,\n      \"series\": 1,\n      \"repetitions\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 60,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 50\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Ponte de Glúteos\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Glúteos e Posterior da Coxa\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se de costas, dobre os joelhos e levante os quadris mantendo a coluna neutra.\",\n      \"time\": 30,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 45,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 60,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 30\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Mountain Climbers\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Abdominal e Cardio\",\n      \"type\": \"Aeróbico\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Posição de prancha, alternar joelhos para o peito rapidamente, mantendo o core engajado.\",\n      \"time\": 40,\n      \"timeExec\": 40,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 60,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 70\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Prancha Lateral com Rotação\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Core\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Posição de prancha lateral, rodar o tronco para tocar o ombro no chão, alternando lados.\",\n      \"time\": 30,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 60,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 25\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Puxada com Banda de Resistência\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Costas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fixar a banda em uma âncora, puxar para o peito com cotovelos baixos, evitando movimento brusco no ombro.\",\n      \"time\": 40,\n      \"timeExec\": 40,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 60,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 40\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Bird-Dog\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Core e Hips\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Posição de quatro apoios, estenda braço e perna opostos, mantendo a coluna estável.\",\n      \"time\": 30,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 8,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 60,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 20\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Alongamento Geral\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Geral\",\n      \"type\": \"Alongamento\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Alongar músculos trabalhados, com foco em glúteos, costas e hamstrings.\",\n      \"time\": 300,\n      \"timeExec\": 300,\n      \"series\": 1,\n      \"repetitions\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 0,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 0\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
