  "output": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a personalized workout plan based on the user's JSON data. Let me start by analyzing the provided information.\n\nThe user is 50 years old, weighs 85kg, and is 180cm tall. Their goal is to gain muscle, which is crucial. They have an advanced experience level, so the workout can be more intense and varied. They have access to a gym, which opens up a lot of equipment options.\n\nSince their fitness goal is muscle gain, the focus should be on resistance training with adequate volume and progression. For an advanced user, I'll include compound movements and some isolation exercises to target all major muscle groups.\n\nThey can train 3 times a week, so I'll structure a 3-day split. Each day should target different muscle groups to allow recovery. Let's go with Push, Pull, Legs split. That way, each session is focused and efficient.\n\nLooking at the available equipment, I can include barbells, dumbbells, and machines. I need to ensure each workout has a mix of these to keep it varied and hit each muscle from different angles.\n\nNo physical restrictions, so I can include heavy lifts and compound movements without worrying about injuries.\n\nNow, I'll outline each day:\n\nDay 1: Push (Chest, Shoulders, Triceps)\n- Start with Bench Press for chest.\n- Incline Dumbbell Press to target upper chest.\n- Overhead Press for shoulders.\n- Cable Fly for chest isolation.\n- Tricep Dips and Skull Crushers for triceps.\n\nDay 2: Pull (Back, Biceps)\n- Deadlifts for overall back strength.\n- Pull-Ups or Lat Pulldown as an alternative.\n- Bent-Over Rows for upper back.\n- Face Pulls for rear delts and upper back.\n- Barbell Curls and Hammer Curls for biceps.\n\nDay 3: Legs\n- Squats for overall leg development.\n- Romanian Deadlifts for hamstrings.\n- Leg Press for quads.\n- Calf Raises for lower legs.\n- Lunges for functional strength and balance.\n\nI need to ensure each exercise has proper instructions, sets, reps, and rest periods. For compound movements, higher sets and reps around 6-8 are good for strength and hypertrophy. Isolation exercises can have higher reps, around 12-15, to pump the muscles.\n\nRest periods between sets should be around 60-90 seconds for strength and 30-60 for hypertrophy. I'll mix these based on the exercise type.\n\nThe workout name should be something catchy and clear, like \"Hiper Trophy 3.0\" to indicate it's an advanced muscle-building program.\n\nThe observations should summarize the program's focus on compound lifts, progressive overload, and overall muscle growth, encouraging the user to adjust weights and track progress.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each exercise is detailed with all necessary parameters.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Hiper Trophy 3.0\",\n  \"workoutObs\": \"Treino intensivo para ganho de massa muscular, focado em exercícios compostos e progressão de carga.
