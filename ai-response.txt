  "output": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a personalized workout plan for the user based on the provided JSON. Let me start by analyzing the user's profile.\n\nThe user is 50 years old, weighs 85kg, and is 180cm tall. Their main goal is to lose weight, which means the workout should focus on burning calories and possibly building lean muscle to boost metabolism. They have an intermediate experience level, so the exercises shouldn't be too basic but also not overly complicated.\n\nThey have access to a gym, which is great because that opens up a variety of equipment options. However, they have a physical restriction: tendinitis in the right shoulder, which causes pain. This is crucial. I need to avoid any exercises that might strain the shoulder, especially those involving heavy lifting overhead or putting pressure on that joint.\n\nThe weekly frequency is three times, so the plan should be efficient within that. Each session should be around 60 minutes, so I'll structure the workout to fit within that time frame.\n\nLooking at the example JSON, the structure includes exercise name, muscle group, type, instructions, time (which seems to be total time), timeExec (execution time per set), series, reps, rest periods, weight, and calories burned. I need to ensure each exercise is safe for the shoulder and aligns with the weight loss goal.\n\nLet me brainstorm exercises that are effective for weight loss, work multiple muscle groups, and don't involve heavy shoulder use. Maybe include some compound movements but modified to avoid shoulder strain.\n\n1. Squats are excellent for legs and overall calorie burn. They don't heavily involve the shoulders, so that's a good start.\n\n2. Lunges target similar muscle groups and can be done without straining the shoulder.\n\n3. Push-ups are great for the chest and triceps. Since they don't require overhead movement, they should be safe if done correctly.\n\n4. For the back, seated rows are good because they don't require heavy overhead lifting. They work the latissimus dorsi without straining the shoulder too much.\n\n5. Planks are excellent for core stability and don't affect the shoulders negatively.\n\n6. The stationary bike is a low-impact cardio option that's easy on the joints and can help with calorie burn without shoulder involvement.\n\n7. Russian twists target the obliques and can be done without heavy weights, so that's a safe addition.\n\nNow, I'll structure each exercise with the necessary details, ensuring the weight and reps are appropriate for an intermediate level and the goal of weight loss. I'll also make sure the rest periods are adequate to prevent overexertion but keep the session moving to maintain calorie burn.\n\nThe workout name should reflect the full-body approach and the weight loss goal. Something like \"Full Body Burn & Strengthen\" sounds catchy and descriptive.\n\nI need to ensure that each exercise's instructions avoid any movements that could aggravate the shoulder tendinitis. For example, in the seated row, using a neutral grip and avoiding heavy weights. For push-ups, ensuring proper form to prevent shoulder impingement.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the calories burned for each exercise based on average estimates to provide the user with an idea of the workout's intensity.\n\nPutting it all together, the workout plan should be balanced, safe, and effective for the user's goals and restrictions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutName\": \"Full Body Burn & Strengthen\",\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Agachamento com barra curvada\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Segure a barra curvada com as mãos afastadas nos ombros, abaixe o corpo até os quadris fiquem abaixo dos joelhos, depois empurre para volta à posição inicial.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 90,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 120,\n      \"weight\": 20,\n      \"calories\": 80\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Puxada alta com corda\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Costas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Pegue a corda com as mãos afastadas, puxe a corda na altura do queixo, mantendo os cotovelos próximos ao corpo, volte à posição inicial.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 25,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 90,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 120,\n      \"weight\": 12,\n      \"calories\": 70\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Bicicleta fixa\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Cardio\",\n      \"type\": \"Aeróbico\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Sentar na bicicleta fixa e pedalar em um ritmo constante.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 300,\n      \"series\": 1,\n      \"repetitions\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 120,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 120\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Flexão de braço no apoio\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Peitoral\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Coloque as mãos no chão, afastadas dos ombros, abaixe o corpo até o peito chegar perto do chão, depois empurre para volta à posição inicial.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 120,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 50\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Prancha abdominal\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Abdômen\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se de bruços com os antebraços no chão, levante o corpo mantendo a posição reta, segure até sentir a queima no abdômen.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 30,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 120,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 40\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Remada sentada com corda\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Costas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Sentar na máquina de remada, puxar a corda até os joelhos, mantendo as costas retas, volte à posição inicial.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 25,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 90,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 120,\n      \"weight\": 15,\n      \"calories\": 75\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Elevação lateral com halteres\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Ombros\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Pegue halteres nas mãos, leve os braços lateralmente até os ombros, abaixe devagar.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"timeExec\": 20,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 120,\n      \"weight\": 8,\n      \"calories\": 45\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
