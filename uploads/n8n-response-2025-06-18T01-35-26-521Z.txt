  "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a workout plan for the user based on the provided JSON data. Let me start by analyzing the information given.\n\nThe user's ID is 1, and their name is João Silva. He's 34 years old, weighs 75kg, and is 175cm tall. His main goal is to gain muscle, which is important because it influences the type of exercises and the structure of the workout.\n\nHis fitness experience is intermediate, so the exercises should be a bit challenging but not too advanced. He works out 4 times a week, which is good because it allows for a split routine. The available equipment includes dumbbells, barbell, and a pull-up bar. He also has access to a cord and a medicine ball, which adds some variety to the exercises. However, he has a knee injury, so I need to avoid any exercises that might strain his knee, like deep squats or lunges.\n\nHe prefers to work out in the evening and has 5 available days per week. Each workout should last around 45 minutes, so the plan needs to be efficient. His diet is high-protein, which supports muscle gain, and he sleeps well, which is beneficial for recovery.\n\nConsidering his goal of gaining muscle, I should focus on compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups. Since he has a knee injury, I'll avoid any heavy leg exercises that might aggravate it. Maybe focus more on upper body and core exercises that don't require heavy knee involvement.\n\nLet me plan a 4-day split. Since he can't do heavy leg work, perhaps focus on pushing, pulling, shoulders, and core. Each workout should have 3-4 exercises, each with 3-4 sets. Repetitions should be in the hypertrophy range, around 8-12 reps.\n\nFor example, on Day 1 (Push Day), exercises like bench press with dumbbells, incline dumbbell press, push-ups, and lateral raises. Each exercise should have instructions, sets, reps, and rest periods. I'll make sure the rest between sets is adequate, around 60-90 seconds, and longer rest between exercises, maybe 120 seconds.\n\nOn Day 2 (Pull Day), pull-ups, bent-over rows with dumbbells, seated rows with a cord, and face pulls. Again, ensuring the knee isn't strained.\n\nDay 3 can be Shoulder Day with overhead press, front raises, lateral raises, and reverse fly. Day 4 can focus on Core with exercises like plank, Russian twists, leg raises, and cable crunches using the cord.\n\nI need to make sure each exercise's instructions are clear and concise. The weight should be challenging but manageable for his intermediate level, around 10-15 kg for upper body exercises. For core exercises, bodyweight or medicine ball can be used.\n\nCalories burned should be estimated based on the exercise intensity and duration. Each exercise might burn around 50-100 kcal, depending on the effort.\n\nI should also vary the equipment to include the available tools like dumbbells, barbell, pull-up bar, cord, and medicine ball to keep the workouts interesting and effective.\n\nNow, I'll structure each workout day with the appropriate exercises, sets, reps, and rest periods, ensuring it fits within the 45-minute window. I'll make sure to include warm-up advice and nutritional tips, even though the user didn't ask for them, just to cover all bases.\n\nI should also keep track of the last 10 workouts for this user, but since this is the first one, I'll just note it down for future reference.\n\nAlright, putting it all together, I'll create a JSON with four workout days, each targeting different muscle groups, using the available equipment, and respecting the user's physical restrictions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Supino reto com halteres\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Peitoral\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se no banco reto e empurre os halteres para cima até esticar os braços.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 10,\n      \"calories\": 50\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Puxada alta com corda\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Costas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Puxe a corda para cima, mantendo os cotovelos próximos ao corpo.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 60\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Abdominal com bola medicinal\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Abdômen\",\n      \"type\": \"Resistência\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se na bola, elevando os pés e fazendo movimentos de abdominal.\",\n      \"time\": 30,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 30,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 60,\n      \"weight\": 5,\n      \"calories\": 40\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
