  "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a workout plan based on the user's JSON profile. Let me start by understanding the user's details.\n\nThe user is a 35-year-old male, 1.75 meters tall, weighing 75 kg. His goal is to lose weight and improve overall fitness. He has experience in strength training for about a year, so he's not a complete beginner. However, he has some physical restrictions: shoulder injury, so exercises that strain the shoulders should be avoided. He can train three times a week, each session lasting 60 minutes.\n\nFirst, I should focus on exercises that don't involve heavy shoulder work. Since his goal is weight loss and fitness, a mix of cardio and strength training would be good. But given the shoulder injury, maybe more emphasis on lower body and core without putting too much strain on the upper body.\n\nLet me think about the exercises. For lower body, squats are a staple. They work multiple muscle groups and are good for strength and calorie burn. Lunges could be another option, but maybe bodyweight lunges to avoid putting extra strain. For core, planks are great because they don't require any equipment and are gentle on the shoulders.\n\nFor cardio, brisk walking on a treadmill is low-impact and doesn't require any equipment, which is perfect. Bodyweight exercises like push-ups are usually good, but since he has a shoulder injury, maybe modified push-ups on knees would be better to reduce strain.\n\nWait, the example response used some exercises, but I need to make sure I avoid any that might hurt his shoulders. So, avoiding overhead presses or heavy chest exercises that might engage the shoulders too much.\n\nSo, planning a routine with 5 exercises: treadmill walking, squats, push-ups on knees, planks, and lunges. Each with appropriate sets, reps, and rest periods.\n\nI should structure each exercise with the required details: name, muscle group, type, instructions, time if applicable, sets, reps, rest times, weight, and calories burned. Since some exercises don't require weight, like planks and bodyweight squats, I'll note that weight is 0.\n\nCalories burned can be estimated based on the duration and intensity. For example, brisk walking for 10 minutes might burn around 50 kcal, while more intense exercises like squats and lunges could burn more.\n\nI need to make sure the total workout fits within 60 minutes, so timing each part appropriately. Let me calculate the time each exercise will take, including rest periods, to ensure it all adds up without exceeding the time limit.\n\nOkay, I think I have a plan. Let me put it all together in the JSON format as specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Caminhada rápida na esteira\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Cardio\",\n      \"type\": \"Cardio\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Caminhe na esteira com intensidade moderada, mantendo uma velocidade constante.\",\n      \"time\": 10,\n      \"series\": 1,\n      \"repetitions\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 60,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 50\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Agachamento (Squat) corpo livre\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, abra as pernas na largura dos ombros, dobre os joelhos e desça até os quadris estejam alinhados com os joelhos.\",\n      \"time\": 0,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 60,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 45\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Flexão de braço (Push-up) joelhos no chão\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Peitoral\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Apoie os joelhos no chão, mantenha o corpo reto e faça flexões de braço.\",\n      \"time\": 0,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 60,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 30\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Prancha (Plank) \",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Core\",\n      \"type\": \"Resistência\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de bruços, apoiando os antebraços no chão, mantenha o corpo reto e retentiva a posição.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 0,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 30,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 60,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 25\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Ponta de pé (Calf Raises)\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, levante os calcanhares do chão, mantenha por 2 segundos e desça lentamente.\",\n      \"time\": 0,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 15,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 60,\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"calories\": 35\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
