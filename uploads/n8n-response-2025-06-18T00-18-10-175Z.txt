  "output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a personalized workout plan for this user. Let me first look at the user's profile.\n\nThe user is male, 30 years old, weighs 70kg, and is 175cm tall. His goal is to lose weight, so I should focus on exercises that burn calories and build some muscle to boost metabolism.\n\nHe has intermediate experience, so the exercises shouldn't be too basic but also not too advanced. He mentioned knee problems, so I need to avoid any heavy impact on the knees. That means no deep squats or lunges that might strain them.\n\nHe's available to work out 3 times a week, so the plan should be efficient within that frequency. Each session should have a good mix of exercises without being too long.\n\nLooking at the sample JSON, it includes 6 exercises. I'll aim for a similar structure but adjust based on the user's needs.\n\nFirst exercise: Maybe something for the chest since it's a major muscle group. Incline dumbbell press could target the upper chest without putting too much strain on the knees.\n\nNext, for the back, pull-ups are great, but since he might not have access to a pull-up bar, maybe seated rows with a machine would be better and easier on the knees.\n\nFor legs, since knees are a problem, leg press is a good option because it's lower impact. It works the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes without heavy stress on the knee joint.\n\nShoulder press with dumbbells can help build shoulder strength and contribute to overall upper body fitness.\n\nPlank is excellent for core stability and doesn't put any strain on the knees. It's functional and helps with overall core strength.\n\nFor cardio, stationary bike is low impact and good for the knees. It will help with the weight loss goal without putting stress on the joints.\n\nNow, setting the details for each exercise. For each, I'll determine the number of series, repetitions, rest times, weights, and calories burned.\n\nI should make sure the rest periods are adequate to allow recovery but not too long to keep the workout efficient. Weights should be challenging but not so heavy that form is compromised, especially considering the knee issues.\n\nCalories burned are estimates based on the exercise and duration. For example, the stationary bike at moderate intensity for 20 minutes burns around 200 kcal.\n\nI'll structure each exercise with clear instructions, focusing on proper form to prevent injury, especially around the knees.\n\nFinally, I'll compile all this into a JSON format as specified, making sure each field is correctly filled and the plan is balanced to meet the user's goals and constraints.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"workoutPlan\": [\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Supino inclinado com halteres\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Peitoral\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Deite-se no banco inclinado e empurre os halteres para cima até esticar os braços, mantendo os cotovelos ligeiramente afastados.\",\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 12,\n      \"calories\": 45\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Remada curvada com corda\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Costas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Sentado na máquina de remada, puxe a corda para o abdômen, mantendo as costas retas e os cotovelos junto ao corpo.\",\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 12,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 15,\n      \"calories\": 50\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Leg Press\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Pernas\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Sentado na máquina de leg press, empurre a plataforma com os pés, estendendo as pernas e dobrando novamente.\",\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 20,\n      \"calories\": 60\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Supra vento com halteres\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Ombros\",\n      \"type\": \"Força\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de pé, segure halteres nos ombros e empurre para cima até esticar os braços.\",\n      \"series\": 4,\n      \"repetitions\": 10,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 60,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"weight\": 10,\n      \"calories\": 40\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Prancha\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Core\",\n      \"type\": \"Resistência\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Fique de bruços, apoiando-se nos antebraços e dedos dos pés, mantendo o corpo reto e estável.\",\n      \"time\": 60,\n      \"series\": 3,\n      \"repetitions\": 1,\n      \"restBetweenSeries\": 30,\n      \"restBetweenExercises\": 90,\n      \"calories\": 25\n    },\n    {\n      \"exercise\": \"Bicicleta ergométrica\",\n      \"muscleGroup\": \"Cardio\",\n      \"type\": \"Cardio\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Sentado na bicicleta ergométrica, pedaleie em ritmo moderado, ajustando a resistência conforme o nível de condicionamento.\",\n      \"time\": 20,\n      \"series\": 1,\n      \"calories\": 200\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
